# matplotlib_csv
Advanced Python - Matplotlib - using CSV files

This project includes sitka_temps_1,sitka_temps_2,sitka_temps_3,Death_valley_1,Death_valley_2 and the 3 csv files. I used enumerate concepts to call variable information from both csv files by its header name (EX:date_index = header_row.index('DATE')). I repeated the 'for' loop twice to access both sitka and death valley data. I used the information to create subplots for both Death Valley and Sitka Weather. I customized both plots and added a title for its corresponding graph and a title for the entire subplot page.
